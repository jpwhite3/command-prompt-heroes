## Facilitator Mindset

- **You’re the guide, not the driver.** Help learners discover the answers themselves.
- **Celebrate every small win.** Opening the terminal is a milestone for many!
- **Stay playful.** Keep it light. The theme is fun for a reason.
- **Redirect fear.** Reframe errors as progress: “This is what learning looks like.”

## Common Learner Struggles

| Struggle | Symptom | Tip |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Command line anxiety | Won’t open terminal | Offer to open it together and explain it’s just another way to give instructions |
| Typing errors | `python hello.py` returns “File not found” | Check spelling, file location, and current directory |
| Indentation issues | Python error: IndentationError | Show how tabs/spaces matter and recommend consistent spacing |
| Variable name issues | “NameError” | Ask them to double-check variable names and where they’re defined |
| `input()` hangs | Terminal appears frozen | Remind them they need to type something and hit enter! |
| CSV issues | `ValueError`, blank rows, wrong types | Help them strip whitespace, skip blanks, or use `try/except` |

## Tips for Coaching Beginners

- **Use questions more than answers:**  
  “What do you think this line is doing?”  
  “What happens if we change this number?”

- **Use analogies:**  
  “A variable is like a labeled jar. You can put something in and take it out.”

- **Check posture and eyes:**  
  If someone is just staring at their screen, it’s a good cue to check in.

- **Encourage pair programming:**  
  One types, one navigates. Great for confidence and engagement.

## Spotting “Stuck” Signals

- Lots of backspacing
- Terminal open but nothing typed
- Screen staring or quietly asking no one
- Tab with StackOverflow open but confusion on face

**Approach gently:**  
“Hey, how’s it going? Want to talk it through?”

## High-Impact Encouragement Phrases

- “That’s a great question.”
- “You’re really close.”
- “Everyone runs into this one.”
- “This is the exact thing that helps it stick.”

---

## Room Flow & Engagement

- **Float and roam.** Don’t wait to be asked—check in frequently.
- **Cheer on wins out loud.** “Nice work!” boosts the room.
- **Use the game tie-in.** “You’ve just leveled up your hero!”

## Terminal Cheat Sheet

**Common commands:**

- `cd folder_name` — Change directory
- `ls` or `dir` — List files
- `python script.py` — Run a Python script
- `touch file.txt` (Mac/Linux) / `echo. > file.txt` (Windows) — Create a file
- `cat file.txt` / `type file.txt` — Show file contents

**Common Python patterns:**

```python
print("Hello")
name = input("Enter name: ")
for i in range(3):
    print(name)
```
