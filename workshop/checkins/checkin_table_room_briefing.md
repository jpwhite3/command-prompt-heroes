> Before moving deeper, take a moment to calibrate your tools and assess your understanding.

## Checkpoint Questions

- Can you create a list of values?  
- Can you loop through the list and print each item?

**2. Processing Data:**  
- Can you calculate totals using `sum()`?  
- Can you use `enumerate()` to track positions or labels?

**3. Code Confidence:**  
- On a scale of 1–5, how comfortable are you with working on a small dataset in Python?

>  
> Use your words—explaining helps unlock the next level.
