## Narrative Brief

> Deep in the darkened Archive, you discover a humming console.  
> The monitor blinks: `ACCESS DENIED – INPUT REQUIRED`.  
> Beside it: a file labeled `hello.py`.  
> The Oracle is dormant. Only those who speak its ancient tongue may wake it.  
> Your mission: learn the commands, explore the system, and run the file.  
>  
> The Archive awaits your voice. Enter the command line.

## Part 1 – Terminal Basics (Both Tracks)

> **Goal:** Use your terminal to find and run the `hello.py` file.

### 1. Open your Terminal:

- **Mac/Linux:** Open the **Terminal** app

### 2. Navigate to the Lab Folder:
```bash
cd path/to/your/lab-folder
```
_Hint: Use `cd` (change directory). Use `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) to list what's in the folder._

### 3. Locate the File:
```bash
ls      # Mac/Linux
dir     # Windows
```
_Do you see `hello.py` in the list?_
