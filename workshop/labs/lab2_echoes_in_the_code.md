# Command Prompt Heroes: The Oracle of Lost Knowledge  
## Lab 2: Echoes in the Code

**Time:** ~5–7 minutes  
**Track:** Choose your path:  
- **Easy Mode** — You’re brand new  
- **Hard Mode** — You’ve tinkered before

## Narrative Brief

> The Oracle stirs.  
> It mutters something—garbled text, echoes from a lost age.  
> A file called `message.py` appears in your directory.  
> You must shape the signal. Reformat the fragments into a message the Archive understands.  
>  
> Code is the Oracle’s language. Speak it clearly.

## Part 1 – Python Basics (Both Tracks)

> **Goal:** Edit a Python file to display a message.

### 1. Locate the File:
In your terminal:
```bash
ls      # Mac/Linux
dir     # Windows
```
_Look for `message.py`_

### 2. Open the File:
```bash
nano message.py     # Mac/Linux
notepad message.py  # Windows
```

### 3. Modify the Message:
Change the code to say your name or a message:
```python
print("Hello from the Archive!")
```

### 4. Run the Script:
```bash
python message.py
```
_You should see your new message in the terminal._

## Part 2 – Bonus Challenge (Hard Mode)

> **Optional Challenge:** Send a richer signal with variables and multiple lines.

### 1. Add More Lines:
```python
print("Initializing transmission...")
print("This is a message from the past.")
```

### 2. Use a Variable:
```python
name = "Explorer One"
print("Signal sent by:", name)
```

### 3. Use f-strings (if you’re feeling brave):
```python
print(f"Transmission received from {name}")
```

## Checkpoint – What Just Happened?

Take a moment to reflect. Can you now:
- Edit and run a Python file?
- Display output with `print()`?
- Use simple variables?

If yes, **you’ve learned to speak to the Oracle.**
