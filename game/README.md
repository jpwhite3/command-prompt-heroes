# Command Prompt Heroes — Companion Game

![title-screen](title-screen.png)

**Command Prompt Heroes** is the official mini-game companion to the *Command Prompt Heroes: The Oracle of Lost Knowledge* workshop. Designed as both a warm-up and a celebration, it helps participants internalize Command Prompt literacy through fast-paced play and retro-inspired visuals.

## What Is It?

A retro-style terminal emulator game where players have 60 seconds to type as many valid commands as they can remember. The more correct commands you enter, the higher your score. It tracks performance and gives instant feedback.

## How It Fits Into the Workshop

| Phase | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Before the Workshop** | Low-pressure, fun intro that gets people in the mindset. Most participants will score low at first. |
| **During the Workshop** | Mentions and visuals tie the game and workshop together. Players are *Command Prompt Heroes* in both worlds. |
| **After the Workshop** | Players re-attempt the game and usually get higher scores. This reinforces what they’ve learned and creates a satisfying payoff. |
