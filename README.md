## Workshop Overview

This experience blends storytelling, terminal navigation, and core Python concepts into a two-hour hands-on learning journey. No prior coding experience is required. Participants play the role of a **Command Prompt Hero** in a future where knowledge has been lost and AI systems have failed. The only way to reclaim the past is through the Archive—a repository of preserved knowledge accessible only through the command prompt and code.

**Learning Objectives**

- Develop foundational command prompt literacy (navigation, file interaction, script execution)
- Understand and apply Python programming basics (variables, logic, file handling)
- Build real-world automation scripts for common business data problems
- Improve technical confidence and code fluency in a safe, low-pressure environment
- Learn how to read, adapt, and understand simple code—even with no prior experience

**Designed for Non-Coders**

This experience is crafted specifically for those who work alongside technical teams but don’t write code themselves—project managers, analysts, operations leads, and curious professionals who want to better understand the digital tools shaping their work.

### Concept: The Oracle of Lost Knowledge

In a distant, AI-dominated future where no one remembers how machines work, participants take on the role of digital explorers uncovering a forgotten data center. At its core: an ancient terminal known as the Oracle of Lost Knowledge—a powerful machine that can only be accessed through the lost arts of coding and command prompt interaction. Guided by a mysterious manual called the Tome of Wisdom, participants will progress through a series of hands-on labs, unlocking deeper access to the Oracle as they master essential technical skills.


### Why Use a Dramatic Theme?

The narrative framework—an AI wasteland, a lost Oracle, and the quest for rediscovered knowledge—serves as more than just window dressing. It’s designed to:
- Tap into intrinsic motivation through curiosity, exploration, and play
- Lower intimidation barriers often associated with learning to code
- Create a memorable experience that reinforces technical skills through storytelling
- Encourage persistence by framing challenges as heroic milestones

Participants don’t just complete labs—they unlock knowledge, solve puzzles, and “save the future” through skill.
